## 1. Schedule

 * What is your team's weekly schedule of meetings outside of regular class times? 
 
 The team is loosely divided into two subgroups: UI and Database, these subgroups have daily scrums to identify blocks and delegate work. We also have a weekly meeting on Thursdays where larger decisions are made, such as routine changes we will be making for iteration 2. All team members put in work on their own time and commit regularly to keep progress going, however the team has a "No Soft Eng Day" on Fridays to keep us rested and so that we can catch up on other work.
