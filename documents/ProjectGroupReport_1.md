## 1. Schedule

 * What is your team's weekly schedule of meetings outside of regular class times? 
 The team is loosely divided into two subgroups: UI and Database, these subgroups have daily scrums to identify blocks and delegate work. We also have a weekly meeting on Thursdays where larger decisions are made, such as routine changes we will be making for iteration 2. All team members put in work on their own time and commit regularly to keep progress going, however the team has a "No Soft Eng Day" on Fridays to keep us rested and so that we can catch up on other work.

## 2. Iteration 1 - Summary

 * Include as summary of your `Iteration-1` accomplishments. 
 Iteration 1 saw the completion of a functional database and the layout of most of the routes our app will be using. Furthermore, we developed a functional UI to be improved upon in later iterations. At the end of Iteration-1: students and faculty can register and sign in, upon signing in they can view created positions and view their own profile, students can create an application form (though they cannot actually apply yet).
 * List the user stories completed in `Iteration-1`. Mention who worked on those user stories. 

----
## 3. Iteration 1 - Sprint Retrospective

 * Include the outcome of your `Iteration-1 Scrum retrospective meetings`. 
 * Mention the changes the team will be doing to improve itself as a result of the Scrum reflections.

## 4. Product Backlog refinement

 * Have you made any changes to your `product backlog` after `Iteration-1`? If so, please explain the changes here. 

----
## 5. Iteration 2 - Sprint Backlog

Include a draft of your `Iteration-2 spring backlog`. 
 * List the user stories you plan to complete in `Iteration-2`. Make sure to break down the larger user stories into smaller size stories. Mention the team member(s) who will work on each user story. 
 * Make sure to update the "issues" on your GitHub repo accordingly.
