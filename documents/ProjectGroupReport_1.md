## 1. Schedule

 * What is your team's weekly schedule of meetings outside of regular class times? 
 
 The team is loosely divided into two subgroups: UI and Database, these subgroups have daily scrums to identify blocks and delegate work. We also have a weekly meeting on Thursdays where larger decisions are made, such as routine changes we will be making for iteration 2. All team members put in work on their own time and commit regularly to keep progress going, however the team has a "No Soft Eng Day" on Fridays to keep us rested and so that we can catch up on other work.

## 3. Iteration 1 - Sprint Retrospective

 * Include the outcome of your `Iteration-1 Scrum retrospective meetings`. 

Our meetings generally consisted of just check-ins discussing what we accomplished, what we are struggling with, and what we will work on next. In our Iteration-1 Scrum retrospective meeting, we discussed some of the hiccups we ran into and how we will ensure they will not appear again in iterations 2 and 3.

 * Mention the changes the team will be doing to improve itself as a result of the Scrum reflections.

- distribute boilerplate code more efficiently
- internal due dates
- assign based on when people are free instead of who wants what
