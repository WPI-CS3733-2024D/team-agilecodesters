## 1. Schedule

-   What is your team's weekly schedule of meetings outside of regular class times?

The team is loosely divided into two subgroups: UI and Database, these subgroups have daily scrums to identify blocks and delegate work. We also have a weekly meeting on Thursdays where larger decisions are made, such as routine changes we will be making for iteration 3. All team members put in work on their own time and commit regularly to keep progress going, however the team has a "No Soft Eng Day" on Fridays to keep us rested and so that we can catch up on other work.

## 2. Iteration 2 - Summary

-   Include as summary of your `Iteration-2` accomplishments.

    -   Fixed the various forms throughout the website, where UI was broken and overlapping itself.
    -   Restricted access of Students and Faculty to only pages they should be allowed to access.
        -   Eg. Students cannot access the /create_position url
    -   UI for the index page was improved and sorting was introduced.
    -   Students can now apply to positions and withdraw their applications
    -   Faculty can see all applications to their position and reject students, though they cannot accept them as of now.
    -   Included Programming Languages as a field for both Students and Research positions.
    -   Included an About Us page that as of now has nothing meaningful.

-   List the user stories completed in `Iteration-2`. Mention who worked on those user stories.
    -   As a student, I can share another professor as a reference so that they can share their recommendations on my behalf.
    -   As a student, I can share a brief statement of interest with the professors.
    -   As a student, I should submit a brief statement describing why I am interested in this research topic and what I hope to gain by participating in that project.
    -   As a faculty member, I can share the project’s goals and objectives to persuade any interested users to join my project.
        -   Amber
    -   As a faculty member, I can share my project’s title to give students a very basic understanding of my project.
        -   Amber
    -   As a faculty member, I can share the time commitment so that interested students know what they are getting into.
    -   As a faculty member, I can share the start and end dates to ensure that all students interested in the project immediately know if the project can fit their schedules or not.
        -   Amber

## 3. Iteration 2 - Sprint Retrospective

Our scrum meetings in Iteration 2 were more helpful, with members sharing what was blocking them and other members helping to solve issues. Communication throughout the sprint was also more effective and all members seemed equally intent on completing the tasks well before the deadline.Based on the success of this sprint we do not aim to make changes to our workstyle going into Iteration 3.

## 4. Product Backlog refinement

## At this point there are no open user stories, the issues we continue to work on are bugs and extra enhancements we wish to make with the time we have.

## 5. Iteration 3 - Sprint Backlog

Include a draft of your `Iteration-3 spring backlog`.

-   List the user stories you plan to complete in `Iteration-3`. Make sure to break down the larger user stories into smaller size stories. Mention the team member(s) who will work on each user story.
-   Make sure to update the "issues" on your GitHub repo accordingly.
    **There are no user stories to complete in Iteration-3, however, here are the issues we currently have; tagged either 'bug' or 'enhancement'** - no way to remove languages or topics of interest in the edit profile page - Amber - Accepting an application does nothing - Sort by relevancy - Amber - Add in new programming languages like topics of interest - Amber - in edit profile it doesnt preselect the topics of interest you already had picked - make the add additional skills thingy more intuitive using append_entry() - sorting by research field / topics of interest probably doesn't work idk though
